## Description
Developer's Best Friend is a simple Laravel Application that enables users to obtain random data to help them develop their websites. The can select how many paragraphs or lorem ipsum text that they need, or they can elect to generate random users. With the users, they have the option of including a dummy address and/or email along with the name.

## Demo
A short video demo of my app can be found [here](http://www.screencast.com/users/cmajocha/folders/Default/media/bc7017d3-86ee-4a71-b7fe-ea573782c6d9).

## Details for the Teaching Team
